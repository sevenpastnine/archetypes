# Archetypes

This repository is collecting archetype representing logical units in a dataset starting as small as quantities as union of a value and a unit to archetypes for chemicals, instruments and references finally to complete metadata standards for specific experiments. 

Open questions:
1) How do we treat general archetypes, which needs to then be replaced by more specific ones? For example: general reference --> paper (with specific fields like issue and page numbers not included in references like talks and posters)
2) Should we allow to mark mandatory information?
